# Workday_Schedular


## My Journey and development

Building a Planner using html, CSS, JavaScript and moment js.

## User Story

***************************
I WANT a planner that hightlights the activites I have planned in the future and have completed in the past. 

**************************

## Concept of the design and function


WHEN I type in my activities in a time slot
THEN I am able to save it on the workday schedular
WHEN I view my workday schedular
THEN I am able to see the past, present, and future
